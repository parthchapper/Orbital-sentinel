# Hosting the console on GitHub Pages

The console in `site/` is a static site: no build step, no bundler, no server,
no API keys, no external requests once the page has loaded. Everything —
orbital mechanics, power model, hyperspectral retrieval, intake scheduler,
3D globe — runs in the browser.

---

## The three-minute version

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.**
3. Push to `main`. The included workflow verifies and publishes.
4. Your console is at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

That's it. The workflow at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs the parity
harness and the headless console check *before* publishing, so a broken build
never reaches the URL.

---

## Without Actions

Pages can also serve a folder directly, but it must be the repository root or
`docs/`, and this site lives in `site/`. Two options:

**Option A — publish a branch (keeps the repo tidy):**

```bash
git subtree push --prefix site origin gh-pages
```
Then set **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `gh-pages` / root**.

**Option B — rename the folder:**

```bash
git mv site docs
```
Then set **Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/docs`**. Update the paths
in `.github/workflows/*.yml` if you keep using them.

`site/.nojekyll` is already present, which stops Jekyll from stripping files —
keep it in whichever folder you publish.

---

## Local preview

```bash
npm run serve        # http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

Any static server works — `python3 -m http.server 4173 -d site` is equivalent.

It must be served over HTTP, not opened as a `file://` path: the console uses
ES modules and `fetch` for its coastline data, and both are blocked on the
file protocol.

---

## Paths and subdirectories

Every reference in the site is relative (`./vendor/three.module.js`,
`styles/console.css`, `map3d/data/…`), so it works unchanged at a user page
(`user.github.io`), a project page (`user.github.io/repo/`), or any
subdirectory of any other host. There is no base URL to configure.

---

## What gets served

```
site/
  index.html          the console
  app.js              bootstrap and wiring
  .nojekyll           stop Jekyll from eating the underscore-free files
  styles/console.css  the whole design system
  engine/             the mission model, ported from worker/app/
  ui/                 panels: map, spectroscopy, scheduler, log, timeline, tour
  map3d/              the three.js globe module + baked coastline vectors
  vendor/             three.js r170 (MIT), vendored so nothing is fetched
```

Roughly 1.9 MB total, of which three.js is 1.3 MB. It fits comfortably inside
the Pages soft limit of 1 GB and loads in well under a second on a normal
connection.

## Verification

```bash
npm run check
```

Runs three things:

| | |
|---|---|
| `tools/dump_reference.py` | regenerates reference outputs from the Python worker |
| `tools/parity-check.mjs` | asserts the browser engine reproduces all 20,410 of them |
| `tools/site-check.mjs` | boots the console in headless Chromium, drives all three modes, exercises every interaction, screenshots each |

The parity harness matters more than it looks. The site runs a JavaScript port
of the Python mission worker, and two implementations of one model drift
silently unless something is watching. It compares the full state at 16 slider
positions, all 96 spectral bands, 288 cells of the chlorophyll field, and both
plants' 24-hour schedules — including the value-noise hash, which is the single
easiest thing to port wrong and the hardest to notice.

The site check needs Chromium:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
# or, against a browser you already have:
CHROMIUM_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium node tools/site-check.mjs
```

---

## Custom domain

Add a `CNAME` file containing your domain to `site/`, and point a DNS `CNAME`
record at `<user>.github.io`. The workflow uploads the whole folder, so it
will be published with everything else.

---

## Browser requirements

ES modules, import maps, WebGL, `ResizeObserver` — all baseline since 2023.
The console degrades rather than fails: if WebGL is unavailable the 3D globe
is replaced with a notice and every other panel, including the 2D swath map,
keeps working. `localStorage` is wrapped in try/catch so private windows are
fine.
